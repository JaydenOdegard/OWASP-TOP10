# OWASP-TOP10 Repo 🚀🛡️

Welcome to the **OWASP-TOP10** project! 🎯 If you're here, it's because you're serious about leveling up your security skills — and maybe even having some fun while you're at it. This repo is built to give you the kind of practice that actually matters: spotting real issues, thinking critically, and getting your hands dirty in a safe way.

Think of this like a personal training ground where you can sharpen your instincts, break stuff safely, and (hopefully) teach silly billy Brad how to finally harden his legacy Java application. 🐂

## What's Inside 🐂

- **AI_Prompts** 🤖
  - Specially crafted prompts to use with ChatGPT-4o for drilling vulnerabilities, defenses, and critical thinking.

- **Resources** 📚
  - Curated links, cheat sheets, and go-to articles for deepening your OWASP Top 10 mastery.

- **Hands-on Experience** 🔥
  - Example vulnerable apps, labs, and safe environments where you can sharpen your skills and break things (responsibly).

- **Code Review Tactics** 🛠️
  - Real-world checklists, strategies, and templates for reviewing application code with an attacker's mindset and a defender's precision.

## How to Best Use This Repo 🤔

- Use the AI prompts and blast yourself with questions. Get in the habit of looking at code and UNDERSTANDING what could be wrong there.
- Fail fast and fail often. This is the fastest way to learn.
- You don't need to know every coding language. You need to understand the abstract concept behind the vulnerability you're seeing.
- Fact-check what you see. Never just blindly trust AI.
- Document your progression, including your failures. (They're the best teachers.)
- Get a solid grasp of the fundamentals before diving headfirst into hardcore code review.
